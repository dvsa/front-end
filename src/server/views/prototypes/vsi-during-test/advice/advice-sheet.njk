        <p>This vehicle may be fitted with an Electomechanical Parking Brake (EPB). The EPB on these models can be tested with the RBT rollers both for non-ATL (running singularly) or if using an ATL both together. Non-ATL - With rear wheels in rollers activate the EPB and test each wheel in turn. Record the maximum efforts. ATL - With both wheels in the rollers start the rollers and wait until the Park Brake Function light (P with a line through it) has illuminated (after approx 5-7 seconds), activate the EPB and record the efforts. Note: In this test mode the EPB is applied incrementally and it may require up to four operations of the switch to achieve maximum efforts. </p>
        <p>Note: The EPB test function is disabled when the vehicle is driven so it is not possible to test the EPB with either a plate brake tester or decelerometer.</p>
