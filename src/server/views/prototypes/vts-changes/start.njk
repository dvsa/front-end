      Use this to notify DVSA of any changes to fixed test equipment.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading heading--medium  heading-medium">Building alterations</h2>
    <p>You must obtain DVSAâ€™s approval for proposed changes which alter the building before putting them in hand; failure to do so may result in disciplinary action.</p>
    <p>For any other changes to fixed test equipment, once DVSA has been notified you can proceed to have the equipment installed and use it. The changes will be checked by DVSA at the next visit.</p>
    <h2 class="heading heading--medium  heading-medium">Mobile testing equipment</h2>
    <p>The renewal of mobile testing equipment does not have to be notified to DVSA provided that the replacement is on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mot-centre-approved-testing-equipment">current DVSA approved list</a> and will not affect the range of vehicles that can be tested.</p>
